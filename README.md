# Obsidian AI Outliner

Obsidian AI Outliner is designed to transform outlines into fully fleshed-out text using large language models (LLMs). It introduces a new file type, `.outline`, which allows users to expand bullet lists, with any level of indentation, into detailed paragraphs.

## Installing

To install the Obsidian AI Outliner, start by downloading the latest release from the official repository. Copy the downloaded files into the `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-aioutliner` folder. Finally, enable the plugin in Obsidian settings.
